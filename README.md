# LogCatCategorizer

This is a Python project where we use a Logistic Regression to categorize images as to if they are of a cat or not. It is based on the Andrew Ng Coursera Neural Network class. I have added a TKinter UI to make interaction a little easier. This is a work in progress. Right now use the below workflow to use the program.

<p>1. "Train Model" button </p>
<p>2. "Choose your own file" button to select a picture you want to classify</p>
<p>3. "Test Own Image" button to see what algorithm classifies your image as</p>

In the near furture I hope to create a more user friendly UI for this project
